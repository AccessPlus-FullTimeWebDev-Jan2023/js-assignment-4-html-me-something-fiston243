         <p>My experience in the United States was different with my country , in the united states the first things was
            to get a driverâ€™s license before driving a car,
            So I failed twice the test and I had no one to drop me off at work.

         <p>Someone told me to take a break for a couple of weeks before I go back and take the test again.
            It was hard for me go to somewhere with the bus,and also to get at work.
            After 1 month I was suppose again to do the test, this time I had passed it successfully!!!
